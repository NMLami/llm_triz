An HVAC system includes an HVAC unit having a cooling mode and a heating mode for conditioning the air in an inside space, and a programmable thermostat located remotely from the HVAC unit. The HVAC unit may have an onboard controller configured to control when the HVAC unit is in the cooling mode or heating mode, and whether the HVAC unit is activated or not. In some cases, the onboard controller of the HVAC unit may use a common temperature setpoint when controlling in the cooling mode and the heating mode. The programmable thermostat may have a programmable schedule with a plurality of time periods, where each time period has a heating setpoint and a cooling setpoint separated by a dead band. The onboard controller of the HVAC unit may be configured to accept input signals from the remotely located thermostat. The remotely located thermostat may send one or more input signals to the onboard controller of the HVAC unit in accordance with the programmable schedule, where the one or more input signals cause the onboard controller of the HVAC unit to set the HVAC unit to a particular one of the cooling mode and the heating mode, and to activate the HVAC unit so as to condition the air in the inside space in the particular one of the cooling mode and the heating mode 
 What are the primary improvements or benefits that this technology aims to achieve and What potential obstacles or contradictions might arise from implementing this technology ? Write in 2 paragraphs in short.
The primary improvements or benefits of this technology are the ability to remotely control the HVAC system and to program the system to operate in a more efficient and comfortable manner. By using a programmable thermostat located remotely from the HVAC unit, the user can program the system to operate in a way that takes into account their daily schedule and preferences, such as setting the temperature to a higher level during the night and a lower level during the day. This can lead to significant energy savings and a more comfortable indoor environment.
However, there are also potential obstacles or contradictions that may arise from implementing this technology. For example, the remote location of the programmable thermostat may make it more difficult to monitor and control the HVAC system in real-time, which could lead to temperature fluctuations or other issues. Additionally, the use of a programmable thermostat may require additional training or education for the user to properly program and operate the system, which could be a barrier to adoption. Finally, the integration of the programmable thermostat with the onboard controller of the HVAC unit may require additional hardware and software components, which could add complexity and cost to the system.
