An HVAC system includes an HVAC unit having a cooling mode and a heating mode for conditioning the air in an inside space, and a programmable thermostat located remotely from the HVAC unit. The HVAC unit may have an onboard controller configured to control when the HVAC unit is in the cooling mode or heating mode, and whether the HVAC unit is activated or not. In some cases, the onboard controller of the HVAC unit may use a common temperature setpoint when controlling in the cooling mode and the heating mode. The programmable thermostat may have a programmable schedule with a plurality of time periods, where each time period has a heating setpoint and a cooling setpoint separated by a dead band. The onboard controller of the HVAC unit may be configured to accept input signals from the remotely located thermostat. The remotely located thermostat may send one or more input signals to the onboard controller of the HVAC unit in accordance with the programmable schedule, where the one or more input signals cause the onboard controller of the HVAC unit to set the HVAC unit to a particular one of the cooling mode and the heating mode, and to activate the HVAC unit so as to condition the air in the inside space in the particular one of the cooling mode and the heating mode 
 What are the primary improvements or benefits that this technology aims to achieve and What potential obstacles or contradictions might arise from implementing this technology ? Write the main theme of the improvements vs contradictions.
The primary improvements or benefits of this technology are:
1. Increased energy efficiency: By using a programmable thermostat located remotely from the HVAC unit, the temperature in the inside space can be controlled more efficiently, as the thermostat can take into account the temperature of the space and adjust the HVAC unit accordingly.
2. Improved comfort: The programmable thermostat can be programmed to maintain a consistent temperature throughout the day, providing a more comfortable environment for occupants.
3. Reduced energy consumption: By using a programmable thermostat, the HVAC unit can be activated only when necessary, reducing energy consumption and costs.
4. Enhanced user experience: The remote location of the programmable thermostat allows for easy access and control of the HVAC system, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.
However, there are also potential obstacles or contradictions that may arise from implementing this technology, including:
1. Increased complexity: The use of a remote programmable thermostat may add complexity to the HVAC system, requiring additional installation and maintenance costs.
2. Interoperability issues: The integration of the remote thermostat with the onboard controller of the HVAC unit may present interoperability issues, potentially leading to conflicts or incompatibilities between the two systems.
3. Security concerns: The use of a remote programmable thermostat may increase the risk of security breaches, as the system may be vulnerable to hacking or unauthorized access.
4. Cost: The additional cost of the remote programmable thermostat may outweigh the potential benefits, making the technology less attractive to some consumers.
The main theme of the improvements vs contradictions is the balance between the benefits of increased energy efficiency, improved comfort, reduced energy consumption, and enhanced user experience, and the potential obstacles or contradictions of increased complexity, interoperability issues, security concerns, and cost.
