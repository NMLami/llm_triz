       " Document(page_content='Energy efficiency indicators definition  \\n \\n  \\n 1 1. Introduction\\nThis report explains how the ODYSSEE indicators are calculated by sector, with a full description of\\ntheir definition and equations. It provides also the necessary explanation for the interpretation of\\ntheir trends. The data used for their calculations are also clearly identified and defined in the\\ndifferent sectors .\\n1.1. What are the energy efficiency indicators?\\nEnergy efficiency indicators are used to assess the progress in energy efficiency and to measure\\nenergy savings.\\nThe most common indicators are rather simple and relate the energy consumption to an indicator of\\neconomic activity (or consumption unit) measured in physical values (tons, employee, m2 ): they are\\ncalled in ODYSSEE specific or unit energy consumption (see Table 1). Such indicators are also\\nexpressed in terms of CO 2emissions in ODYSSEE.\\nThey are complemented with indicators of market penetration of energy saving technology or\\npractice. These indicators are in principle easier to monitor and more rapidly updated than energy\\nefficiency indicators that depend on the availability of data on end-use consumption. They include:\\n• Market penetration of efficient technologies: number of efficient lamps sold, % of label A++in\\nnew sales of electrical appliances, …\\n• Diffusion of energy efficient practices: % of passenger traffic by public mode, by non-\\nmotorised mode; % of transport of goods by rail, % of efficient motors in industry, …\\n• Market penetration of end-use renewable (% of dwellings with solar water heaters, % of\\nefficientwood boilers for heating, …)\\nAt an aggregate level, energy indicators relate the energy consumption to indicators of activity\\nmeasured in monetary values (GDP, Value Added: they are called energy intensities in ODYSSEE (e.g.\\nkWh/€, toe/€2015)\\nEnergy efficiency indicators considered here are macro-indicators, defined at the level of the\\neconomy as a whole, of a sector, or a sub-sector (industrial process, mode of transport, or end-use or\\nin the household sector).\\nTable 1 : Various types of energy efficiency indicators\\nTypes of indicator Examples\\nSpecific/ unit energy\\nconsumptionlitre/100km, household electrical appliance (kWh/year), heating\\nconsumption per m2or household (eg kWh/m2or household),\\nconsumption per employee or m2 in services (eg kWh/m2or\\n/employee)\\nMarket penetration of\\nenergy saving technology or\\npracticeShare of public transport for passengers, of rail/water for goods,\\nof solar water heaters, of cogeneration, of LED etc…\\nEnergy intensity Indicators in monetary value related to GDP or value added (e.g.\\ntoe/€2015)', metadata={'source': 'def.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Energy efficiency indicators definition  \\n \\n  \\n 2 Usual indicators as described above are useful to describe trends, but cannot explain the observed\\ntrends. For instance the energy consumption per household shows how the overall energy efficiency\\nof households is changing but a decrease does not necessary mean that energy efficiency is\\nimproving from a technical viewpoint.\\nTo enrich the interpretation and better monitor energy efficiency trends, more complex indicators\\nare needed, the so called“advanced indicators”. These indicators do not need additional data: they\\njust use the same data as the usual indicators but include additional calculations.\\nSix types of advanced indicators are considered in ODYSSEE:\\n1. Energy efficiency index to measure EE improvements at sector level.\\n2. Energy savings to quantify the amount of energy saved over a period or for given year .\\n3. Financial indicators to show the financial benefit of energy savings for households.\\n4. Benchmarking indicators to assess how each country performs compared to other countries?\\n5. Decomposition of energy consumption variation to show how energy efficiency\\nimprovements have impacted the energy consumption of the country?\\n6. Avoided CO2 emissions to show what is the effect of energy efficiency improvement on CO2\\nemissions.\\n1.2. Why so many indicators are needed?\\nAltogether, about 200 energy efficiency indicators are proposed by country. For a given sector or\\nend-use several indicators can be considered, for different reasons:\\n• Energy efficiency has different meaning and frontiers (economic efficiency versus technical\\nefficiency). Depending on the perspective, some indicators may be more appropriate than\\nothers. Energy intensities provide for instance an assessment of energy efficiency from an\\neconomic point of view whereas unit consumption are more focused on technical energy\\nefficiency.\\n• First of all, each indicator answers to a specific question. Questions can be raised from a\\npolicy, economic or, technical viewpoint. Depending on the exact question, one or several\\nindicators can be considered.\\n• EE P&Ms are designed and implemented at the level of end-use and equipment (e.g. labels\\nor standards on heating, lighting), or branch (e.g. voluntary agreements, audits). Therefore\\nthe monitoring of each P&M requires detailed indicators (eg kWh/m2 for new buildings with\\nbuilding codes; kWh per refrigerators for labels/standards; gCO2 or toe per km for Bonus-\\nmalus).\\n• Interpretation of indicators is more powerful when combined; for instance comparing trend\\nin energy use per household and per m2 will show the impact of change in dwelling size.\\n• Finally, alternative indicators are often necessary to cope with possible data gaps.', metadata={'source': 'def.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

Energy efficiency index\\nThe index of energy efficiency progress, called“ODEX”is defined at the level of sectors (industry,\\ntransport, households, tertiary) or of the whole economy (all final consumers). This index is obtained\\nby aggregating the unit consumption changes at detailed levels, by sub-sector or end-use, observed\\nover a given period. The unit consumption variation is measured in terms of index, which enable the\\nuse of various units for the detailed indicator (kWh/appliance, toe/m2…).\\nThe ODEX for a sector (e.g. industry, transport or households, tertiary) is calculated as a weighted\\naverage of the unit consumption index of each sub-sector or end-use, with a weight based on the\\nrelative consumption of each sub-sector in the base year. For instance, considering two sub-sectors\\nwith a share of the consumption of 60% and 40% respectively in the base year and a change in the\\nunit consumption from 100 to 85 for the first sub-sector and 100 to 97.5 for the second, the\\nweighted average index is 0.6*(85/100)+0.4* (97.5/100) = 90.\\nODEX is calculated with two definitions:\\n• Technical ODEX that do not takes into account negative energy efficiency trends, which\\nmeans it can only decrease (i.e. which means energy efficiency improvements) or remained\\nstable\\n• Gross ODEX that takes into account negative energy efficiency trends and that can increase\\nover some periods.\\nA separate document gives more details on the calculation of ODEX.\\n \\n1cc: climatic corrections', metadata={'source': 'def.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

Rate of energy saving\\n \\n2.1.3. Energy savings\\n \\nEnergy saving are derived from ODEX. Indeed, the energy efficiency index can also be defined as a\\nratio between the actual energy consumption of the sector in year t and the sum of fictive energy\\nconsumption of each underlying sub-sector /end-use that would have been observed in year t had\\nthe unit consumption of the sub sector been that of a reference year. For instance, if the actual\\nconsumption of the sector is 90 Mtoe and if the unchanged unit consumption in all sub-sectors/end-\\nuses should lead to a sector’s consumption of 100 Mtoe, the index is equal to 90/ 100 = 0.9 or 90, if\\nexpressed as an index. Such an index of 90 means a 10% energy efficiency gain.\\n2.1.4. Primary energy intensity\\nThe primary energy intensity is the ratio between the total energy consumption of a country and the\\nGDP.

More\\nprecisely, five types of factors can be identified:\\n- first of all, changes in the GDP structure between sectors: for instance, the tertiarisation of\\nthe economy, all things being equal, decreases final energy intensity; a decreasing\\ncontribution of energy-intensive branches, such as steel, non-metallic minerals or chemicals,\\nwill also result in a decrease in final energy intensity; this first factor is usually referred to as\\nstructural changes in the economy;\\n- secondly, the spread of energy efficient techniques and equipment or else of more efficient\\nbehaviours and practices;\\n- thirdly, energy substitutions favouring energies with high end-use efficiency (e.g. district\\nheating, natural gas, electricity),\\n- fourthly, other structural changes, such as an increasing share of bigger cars in the stock of\\ncars or of single family dwellings in the stock of dwellings, or else of cars in urban traffic;\\n- finally, an improvement in living standards (i.e. greater confort), with a wider distribution of\\nenergy-consuming appliances: electrical appliances, central heating, cars, for instance.\\nAll these factors usually have contradictory influences: the first three factors have usually drawn final\\nenergy intensities downward, whereas the last two factors tend to increase intensities, all things\\nbeing equal. The contribution of the last factor is all the more decisive as the country is less\\ndeveloped: it probably plays a decisive role in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.\\n2.1.6. Ratio final/primary intensities\\nIt is the ratio final energy intensity/primary energy intensity (i.e. the ratio of final to primary energy\\nconsumption). Divergent trends between the two intensities will be reflected by changing values for\\nthe ratio over time.\\nFor most countries there is a slight decrease in this ratio, indicating that, on average, more and more\\nprimary energy is needed per unit of final energy consumption.\\nLosses in transformation and distribution are responsible for most of the difference between primary\\nand final energy consumption; the rest is explained by non energy uses, that are excluded from the\\nfinal consumption in ODYSSEE\\n➔Interpretation\\nDifferent trends in primary and final energy intensities can be explained by several factors:\\n- changes in the energy supply mix, mainly linked to changes in the electricity generation mix,\\nsince most of the losses (about 3/4) come from electricity generation: an increase in the', metadata={'source': 'def.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Energy efficiency indicators definition  \\n \\n  \\n 8 share of nuclear power generation increases the gap between the two intensities; in\\ncontrast, an increasing share of hydropower or cogeneration narrows this gap.\\n- changes in the efficiency of transformations: for instance, greater efficiency of thermal\\npower plants (e.g. development of gas combined cycle power plants), reduces the ratio of\\nprimary to final intensity.\\n- changes in the share of secondary energies (mainly electricity) in final consumption.\\n- finally, changes in the share of imported secondary energies: for instance, if a country\\nreduces its electricity generation and imports more, this will decrease transformation losses\\nand narrow the gap between the two intensities.\\n2.1.7. Primary or final energy intensity with climatic corrections\\nThe primary or final energy intensity with climatic corrections is a fictive value of these intensities\\nwhere the space heating part of the consumption is corrected so as to correspond to a normal winter\\n(climatic corrections)\\nThe purpose of these climatic corrections is to leave out the influence of cold winter. This is\\nparticularly important when there are large climatic variations from one winter to the other. For\\ninstance, 2015 was a mild winter as well as 1997 leading to a reduction in energy consumption\\ncompared to a normal winter.\\nIf a winter is colder, the consumption will increase more than for a normal winter, and vice versa for\\na milder winter. Energy efficiency indicators without climatic corrections would increase during cold\\nyears and decrease during mild winters, all things being equal. Climatic corrections provide a\\nmeasurement of the consumption over time, and thus of energy efficiency indicators, that is\\nindependent of yearly climatic variations.\\nThe climatic corrections are made only for the part of the final consumption corresponding to space\\nheating. Climate corrections are only made in the residential and service sectors.\\nFor countries without yearly regular data on the space heating consumption , the correction is made\\nwith theheating share approach, by using an assumed share of space heating ; this methodology is\\nexactly the same as the one adopted by EUROSTAT.\\nietoctpccc=toccfcc /(pibxx./txchg€(2015)*1000\\nietoctfccc=toccfcc /(pibxx./txchg€(2015)*1000\\nwith:\\nietoctpccc : primary intensity with climatic corrections (\\nietoctfccc : final intensity with climatic corrections\\ntoccpcc=toccp-tocfres-tocfter+toccfrescc +toccftercc\\ntoccfcc=toccf-tocfres-tocfter+toccfrescc +toccftercc\\ntoccpcc:primary consumption with climatic correction\\ntoccfcc:final consumption with climatic correction\\ntocfres: final consumption of household sector\\ntocfter: final consumption of service sector\\ntocfrescc: final consumption of household sector with climatic corrections\\ntocftercc: final consumption of service sector with climatic corrections', metadata={'source': 'def.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

Final energy intensity at constant GDP structure\\nThe final energy intensity at constant structure is a theoretical intensity that would result from all\\nsectors growing at the same rate as the GDP (i.e. constant GDP structure and constant structure of\\nindustry) and using the actual values of sectoral intensities. The calculation is carried out at the level\\nof the main sectors (industry, agriculture, tertiary, transport and residential) and major industrial\\nbranches.\\nThe final energy intensity at constant GDP structure is a fictitious value of the final energy intensity I,\\ncalculated by assuming that the structure by sector (Sj) is unchanged from the base year and by\\ntaking into account the actual variation in energy intensity of sector (Ij).\\nThe calculation is based on theDivisia methodwhich is a usual method to separate out what is due\\nto structural changes from what is due to changes in sectoral intensities in the variation of the final\\nintensity (see the detailed equations in part3.3.1 Energy intensity of manufacturing at constant\\nstructure).\\nFor the industry, tertiary and agriculture sectors, the sectoral energy intensities are calculated as the\\nratio of final energy consumption to value added. For these sectors, a constant GDP structure means\\nthat their value added increases at the same rate as GDP. In industry, the intensity is measured at\\nconstant structure of industrial at value added, among the usual 10 branches.\\nFor transport, the sectoral energy intensity is calculated as the ratio of transport energy consumption\\nto GDP.\\nFor the residential sector, finally, the intensity is calculated as the ratio of household energy\\nconsumption to private consumption; for this sector, a constant GDP structure means that private\\nconsumption increases at the same rate as GDP.\\nThis energy intensity at constant structure provides an assessment of energy efficiency trends\\ncleared of the influence of structural changes.

However the difference represents not just a greater volume of\\nactivity on Germany, but also a higher general price level.

Data for industry\\n3.2.1. Final energy consumption of industry\\nFinal energy consumption of industryincludes all the fuels used for mining, manufacturing of\\nindustrial goods and construction. It excludes however the energy consumption of the energy\\ntransformation industries (e.g. energy mining, refineries, power plants, gas plants).\\nThe fuels used by industrial factories for transport purposes, e.g. for their fleet of vehicles\\n(“transport for own-account”) are not included in industry, but in the transport sector.\\nThe fuels used in industrial boilers to produce steam are included but not the heat generated.\\nOnly the heat purchased by industrial consumers is considered as a final consumption of heat.\\nThe fuels used for electricity generation and cogeneration of heat and electricity are excluded\\nfrom the final energy consumption of industry. The electricity consumption of industry\\ncombines both purchased and self generated electricity. This mode of accounting is such that\\nchanges in the share of electricity self generated and electricity purchased do not affect the\\nfinal energy consumption of industry. This problem has become especially important now with\\nthe priority given in many countries to private generation (or self generation) by industrial\\nautoproducers. In this accounting, the fuels inputs for self generation of electricity appear in\\nthe line “autoproducers”. In case ofCHP, only the part corresponding to the electricity\\nproduction is included in this line ; the part of fuels corresponding to the heat produced\\nappears in the final consumption.

Table 3 illustrates the methodology of accounting of industrial self-generation and\\ncogeneration.\\nIn case the final consumption is not available, the fuels used for transportation can be\\nestimated from the gasoline and diesel consumption. The fuels used for electricity generation\\ncan be derived from the electricity self generated, information that is usually available. Thus\\nthe diesel consumption needs to split into three parts : transportation, self generation of\\nelectricity and the rest, that corresponds to the final consumption.\\nEnergy products used as a raw materials or chemical products are generally separated or at\\nleast identified in the itemnon energy uses.\\nNon energy uses: consumption of energy products in the petrochemical sector (fabrication of\\norganic materials), in the fabrication of ammonia (natural gas), in furnaces as electrode\\n(carbon), as well as products used for their physico-chemical properties (asphalt, wax, engine\\noils, etc...).\\n3.2.2. Classification of industry by industrial branch\\nClassification of industry: in economic statistics, the output of the industry sector is measured\\nby thevalue added. It is broken down into various industrialsectors, or industrialbranches.\\nAccordingto the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) of economic activity, the\\nindustry sector is split into four major branches : mining, manufacturing, electricity, gas and\\nwater, and construction. Manufacturing is further broken down into various individual\\nbranches : the most usual disaggregation, the two digit one, encompasses 9 branches in the\\nold classification (ISIC Rev 2) and 23 in the new NACE classification (Rev 3) (see table 4) Energy\\nintensive industries such as steel, cement, correspond to 3 to 5 digits level.\\nThe energy transformation industries (i.e. the energy production and transformation\\nactivities), appear at different levels :\\n- in mining (coal mining, oil and gas production) (NACE code 10 and 11 ) ;\\n- in manufacturing (e.g. chemicals for refineries) (NACE 23) ;\\n- in electricity, gas... (including district heating) (NACE 40-41).\\nSectors: corresponds to the grouping of industrial activities into sub-categories on the basis of\\nestablishments (e.g. enterprises). Sectors correspond to all establishments having the same\\nmain activity.\\nBranches: corresponds to the grouping of industrial activities on the basis of the activity :\\nbranches correspond to all enterprises or part of enterprises having the same activity.\\nTable 3 : Classification of industrial branch', metadata={'source': 'def.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

It is less well covered by national statistics6. Value added at constant price\\nare derived from values at current price, using price deflators7. In some case data at constant price\\nhave to be calculated from production index, assuming that the change in the value added at\\nconstant price, i.e. in volume, follows the change in production index (see Box 1).\\n• Production index\\nTheproduction indexby sub-sector is the most common indicator used to measure the industrial\\noutput; it is usually measured in relation to a base year (e.g. index base 100 in 2015 for instance) or\\nin relation to the previous year. It is well covered in national statistics. This index usually measures\\nthe changes in the volume of physical production: it is calculated from index of change in physical\\nproduction at a very detailed level (4 to 5 digits) measured with different units (e.g. number of litres\\nof milk processed, of tons of meat produced for the food industry) and aggregated at the branch\\nlevel (e.g. food) into a production index on the basis of the weight of each sub-branch in the value\\nadded of the branch in the base year (2015).\\n• Physical production\\nThe physical production corresponds to a dominant output of the branch and is usually measured in\\nton (e.g. crude steel, cement, clinker).\\n6 Value added should be preferred to output value (i.e. turn over) as its variation is closer to the physical output.  \\n7 See above definition of price deflators in footnote 6.', metadata={'source': 'def.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",

As the consumption of buses is usually small in comparison\\nto that of trucks, the indicators related to heavy vehicles will mostly reflect the situation of trucks,\\nand can be considered as an approximation for them.\\n➔Interpretation\\nIndicators related to trucks or heavy vehicles should be interpreted with care, as there may be\\nlimitations in the quality of diesel consumption data for these vehicles, for two reasons:\\n-The consumption of diesel by heavy vehicles or trucks is usually obtained as the difference between\\nthe total consumption of diesel and estimates of diesel consumption by cars and light vehicles; in\\nrecent years, most countries have experienced a rapid increase in the proportion of cars and light\\nvehicles using diesel fuel, that may not always be fully reflected in these consumption estimates.\\n- In some countries, an increasing amount of diesel may be used by foreign trucks (transit traffic),\\nwhich are not accounted for in the indicators.\\nThese two factors may lead to an overestimation in recent years of the consumption of diesel by\\ntrucks and heavy vehicles.\\ncugzlhvv=(gzlcfrou-gzlcfvpc-gzlcfvlr) /(nbrcamgzl+nbrbusgzl)*1000 [toe/veh]\\nwith:\\ngzlcfrou, gzlcfvpc, gzlcfvlr: diesel consumption of road, cars & light vehicles\\nnbrcamgzl: stock of diesel trucks\\nnbrbusgzl: stock of diesel bus', metadata={'source': 'def.pdf', 'page': 30}),\n",
