WHEELASSEMBLY FOR ASTROLLER
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
This invention relates to a stroller, and more particularly
to a wheel assembly for a Stroller, which includes a Single
wheel.
2. Description of the Related Art
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a conventional stroller 1 is
5:
2
of a preferred embodiment of this invention, with reference
to the accompanying drawings, in which:
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a conventional stroller that
includes two front wheel assemblies, each of which has two
front wheels;
FIG. 2 is a bottom view of one front wheel assembly of
10
shown to include a stroller frame 10 with four legs 101, two
front wheel assemblies 11 mounted respectively to two of
the legs 101, and two rear wheel assemblies 12 mounted
respectively to the other two of the legs 101. FIG. 2 is a
15
13, a wheel seat 14 disposed between the front wheels 12,
and a wheel axle 15 extending through the front wheels 13
and the wheel seat 14. Each of the wheel seats 14 has a
leg-connecting portion 141 sleeved rotatably on a respective
one of the legS 101, and an axle-connecting portion 142,
within which the wheel axle 15 is journalled. To enhance the
comfort of the baby carried on the stroller 1, a vibration
absorbing device (not shown) can be disposed within the
axle-connecting portion 142 of each of the wheel Seats 14.
When it is desired to push the stroller 1 to advance along
a straight path, a forward force (A) is applied to the Stroller
frame 10. In each of the front wheel assemblies 11, since the
forward force (A) is located midway between two frictional
forces (B) that are generated between the ground and the
-
front wheels 13 and since the direction of the forward force
(A) is parallel to those of the frictional forces (B), the stroller
35
1 can advance along a straight path 16. When the stroller 1
moves over a lawn or uneven road Surfaces, it is necessary
for the Stroller wheels to have a large diameter So as to
ensure the comfort of the baby. However, if each of the front
wheel assemblies 11 has two large-diameter front wheels 13,
the total volume and weight of the stroller 1 will increase
significantly so that it is difficult to push the stroller 1.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The object of this invention is to provide a wheel assem
bly for a stroller, which includes a single wheel, thereby
reducing the total Volume and weight of the Stroller.
According to this invention, a wheel assembly for a
Stroller having a stroller frame is adapted to be mounted to
the Stroller frame, and comprises a wheel unit including a
wheel and a wheel axle that is coupled to the wheel So as to
permit rotation of the wheel about the wheel axle. The wheel
has a rim and a wheel wall. The rim defines a mounting
Space therein, and has a vertical inner Side Surface that is
adapted to be proximate to the Stroller frame, a vertical outer
Side Surface that is opposite to the inner Side Surface and that
is adapted to be distal from the Stroller frame, and a vertical
central plane that is located between the inner and outer side
Surfaces. A fixed Seat is adapted to be mounted fixedly to the
Stroller frame, and has a pivot-mounting portion that extends
into the mounting Space in the wheel of the wheel unit. A
Vertical pivot shaft is disposed on the pivot-mounting por
tion of the fixed Seat, and extends in the central plane of the
rim of the wheel unit. A wheel seat unit is connected to the
wheel unit and the vertical pivot shaft, and is rotatable about
the vertical pivot shaft. The wheel axle is journalled on the
wheel Seat.

includes two side bars 211, a front bar 212 having two ends
that are connected respectively and fixedly to front ends of
the side bars 211, and a rear bar 213 that is connected fixedly
to rear ends of the side bars 211. The front wheel assemblies
40
20 are mounted respectively to two ends of the front bar 212
of the stroller frame 21. The hand-push frame 22 is mounted
pivotally to the side bars 211. The rear wheel assemblies 23
are mounted respectively to two ends of the rear bar 213.
One of the front wheel assemblies 20 will be described in
the Succeeding paragraphs.
The front wheel assembly 20 includes a wheel unit 3, a
45
fixed seat 4, a vertical pivot shaft 5, a wheel seat unit 6, and
a braking mechanism 7.
Referring to FIGS. 3 and 5, the wheel unit 3 includes a
50
55
wheel 31 and a wheel axle 32 that is coupled to the wheel
31 so as to permit rotation of the wheel 31 about the wheel
axle 32. The wheel 31 has a rim 311, a wheel wall 312, and
a mounting space 313 that is defined within the rim 311. The
wheel wall 312 has a circular central portion 314 and three
equidistant radial portions 315 that are connected fixedly to
the central portion 314 and the rim 313. The rim 311 has a
vertical inner side surface 316 that is proximate to the
stroller frame 21, a vertical outer side Surface 316' that is
opposite to the inner side surface 316 and that is distal from
the stroller frame 21, and a vertical central plane 317
between the inner and outer side Surfaces 316, 316".
60
Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, the fixed seat 4 includes a
Vertical base plate 41, a sleeve portion 42 extending inte
grally from the base plate 41 and sleeved fixedly on the front
bar 212 of the stroller frame 21, and a pivot mounting
portion 43 that extends into the mounting space 313 in the
wheel31 of the wheel unit 3 and that is formed with two first
horizontal plates 431 which are aligned along a vertical
direction.

US 6,938,300 B2
3
The vertical pivot shaft S extends through the pivot
mounting portion 43 of the fixed Seat 4, is located in the
central plane 317 of the rim 311, and is formed with a
vertical slot 51 therethrough.
The wheel seat unit 6 includes a rotatable seat 61, a
movable member 62, a resilient element 63, a wheel seat 64,
a horizontal pin 65, a horizontal pivot shaft 66, an axle
surrounding tube 67, and two bearings 68.
The rotatable seat 61 includes a vertical base plate 611,
two Second horizontal plates 612 that extend integrally from
one side Surface of the base plate 611 and that are aligned
along the vertical direction, two first vertical plates 613 that
extend integrally and perpendicularly from an opposite side
Surface of the base plate 611 and that are aligned along a
horizontal direction, and two aligned vertical slots 614. The
second horizontal plates 612 are sleeved rotatably on the
vertical pivot shaft 5, and are disposed between the first
horizontal plates 431 of the fixed seat 4. As such, the
rotatable seat 61 is rotatable relative to the fixed seat 4.
The movable member 62 and the resilient element 63 are
sleeved movably on the vertical pivot shaft S between the
second horizontal plates 612 of the rotatable seat 61. The
resilient element 63 is shaped as a coiled compression
Spring, and is disposed immediately under the movable
member 62 so as to bias the movable member 62 upwardly
toward the upper second horizontal plate 612 of the rotatable
seat 61.
The wheel seat 64 includes two vertical annular plates 641
that are sleeved movably around the wheel axle 32, two
cylindrical sleeves 642 that extend respectively, integrally,
and perpendicularly from outer peripheries of the annular
plates 641 and away from each other, and two Second
vertical plates 643 that are connected fixedly to the annular
plates 641, that are aligned along the horizontal direction,
and that extend respectively through the vertical slots 614 in
the rotatable seat 61. Each of the second vertical plates 643
has a pivot end 644.
The horizontal pin 65 extends through a pin hole 621 in
the movable member 62, the vertical slot 51 in the vertical
pivot shaft 5, and the pivot ends 644 of the second vertical
plates 643 of the wheel seat 64 so that the resilient element
63 can dampen movement of the wheel unit 3 relative to the
stroller frame 21, thereby absorbing vibration of the wheel
unit 3.
The horizontal pivot shaft 66 extends through the first
4
ture and operation of the braking mechanism 7 are not
pertinent to the claimed invention, a detailed description
thereof will be omitted herein for the sake of brevity.
Referring to FIG. 7, when the wheel 31 is disposed at an
inclined position, because the vertical pivot Shaft 5 extends
in the central plane 317 of the wheel31, the wheel seat unit
6 can rotate smoothly relative to the stroller frame 21.
Referring to FIGS. 5 and 8, in which the wheel 31 is
10
shown to be disposed at a forward position, when a forward
force (X) is applied to the Stroller frame 21, because a
frictional force (Y) between the wheel31 and the ground and
the forward force (X) are in the central plane 317, the wheel
31 will move along a Straight path.
15
Referring to FIGS. 6 and 9, when the wheel unit 3 is
Subjected to vibration, the resilient element 63 can dampen
the movement of the wheel unit 3.
Because the front wheel assembly 20 includes only one
wheel 31, the diameter of the latter can be increased Sig
nificantly to enable the stroller to move Smoothly over lawns
and uneven road Surfaces, thereby increasing the range of
application of the front wheel assembly 20.
With this invention thus explained, it is apparent that
numerous modifications and variations can be made without
25
departing the Scope and Spirit of this invention. It is therefore
intended that this invention be limited only as indicated by
the appended claims.
I claim:
