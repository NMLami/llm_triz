The device includes an outer ring, an inner ring, a cover, a sensor, a control circuit, and a battery. The size change allows for a more comfortable fit on different fingers. The invention also includes a GSR sensor, a display, and a dial for operating the display. The device's energy efficiency is not explicitly mentioned, but the use of a non-metal material for the antenna may contribute to reducing energy consumption. However, the potential drawback of the device's size changeability is not discussed.\n"
