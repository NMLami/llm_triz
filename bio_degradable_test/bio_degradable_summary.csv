US,6406636,2002-06-18,"Wafer-to-wafer bonding using, e.g., solder metal bonding, glass bonding or polymer (adhesive) bonding is improved by profiling one or both of the wafer surfaces being bonded to define microstructures therein. Profiling means providing other than the conventional planar bonding surface to define cavities therein. The bonding material fills the cavities in the microstructures. For instance, a system of ridges and trenches (e.g. in cross-section vertical, slanted, key-holed shaped, or diamond-shaped) are microstructures that increase the surface area of the wafers to which the bonding material can adhere. Use of the key-hole shaped or diamond-shaped profile having a negative slope at the trench interior substantially increases the bonding force. Where electrical leads feed through a bond, the seal to the bond at that point is improved by either using lengthened feedthroughs which extend the length of a substantial portion of the bond or by use of doped (diffused) conductive wafer regions rather than metallized feedthroughs. In some cases the bonded surfaces include spacers which define a precisely defined distance between the two wafers, thus providing an exactly specified thickness of the bonding material. In some cases the edges of the bonded assembly are sealed by a sealant which extends through narrow capillary spaces between the two bonded wafers, thus hermetically sealing together the two wafers.","Summary:
The research aims to improve wafer-to-wafer bonding by profiling the wafer surfaces to define microstructures, such as ridges and trenches, which increase the surface area for bonding material adhesion. The use of key-hole shaped or diamond-shaped profiles with a negative slope at the trench interior significantly increases bonding force. The research also explores the use of spacers to define a precisely defined distance between the two wafers and sealants to hermetically seal the edges of the bonded assembly. While the research shows potential for improved bonding strength and sealing, potential drawbacks include the difficulty of manufacturing the microstructures and the potential for degradation due to thermal or mechanical stress.
