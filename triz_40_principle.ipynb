The cell array structure includes a cell area and a connection area, where the cell area has a staircase-shaped cell stack and a plurality of capacitor core contact structures. Each capacitor core contact structure consists of a first core conductor electrically connected to the peripheral circuit, and a first cover insulating layer extending between the first core conductor and the plurality of gate electrodes.

However, the invention may face challenges in manufacturing and scaling due to the complexity of the structure.\\nThe paragraph provided matches which principles and why. Can you give me in points and one line for the reason.\\n\\nHelpful Answer:\\n\\nPoints:\\n\\n1. Principle 17 - Another Dimension\\nReason: The staircase-shaped cell stack in the cell array structure allows for a reduction in overall power requirements by using less floor area.\\n\\n2. Principle 33 - Homogeneity\\nReason: The peripheral circuit structure and the cell array structure are made of the same material (or material with identical properties), which reduces chemical reactions and improves the device's performance.\\n\\n3. Principle 7 - Nested Doll\\nReason: The cell array structure is placed inside the peripheral circuit structure, which allows for the reduction of the need to raise or lower the cell array structure.\\n\\n4. Principle 12 - Equipotentiality\\nReason: The connection area of the cell array structure is bonded to the peripheral circuit structure, which eliminates the need to raise or lower the cell array structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\""
