US,4927472,1990-05-22,"A conversion coating, predominantly consisting of tin phosphate, can be deposited on steel or tin plated steel surfaces by contact with a solution containing phosphate ions, tin ions, an oxidizing agent such as chlorate, and a chelating agent for the tin ions, the latter to prevent the rapid loss of tin from the solution that otherwise would occur. A coating that confers excellent resistance to corrosion in hot water is formed on drawn and ironed thinly tin plated cans.","Summary:
The research aims to improve the corrosion resistance of steel or tin plated steel surfaces by depositing a conversion coating consisting mainly of tin phosphate through contact with a solution containing phosphate ions, tin ions, an oxidizing agent, and a chelating agent. The coating provides excellent resistance to corrosion in hot water and is particularly useful for drawn and ironed thinly tin plated cans. However, the rapid loss of tin from the solution is a potential drawback, and the energy efficiency of the process is not explicitly mentioned."
US,5352331,1994-10-04,"An etching process for patterning thin film cermet (14) on a semiconductor substrate (10) using a mild, room temperature acid solution as the etchant. The semiconductor substrate (10) has a glass passivating layer (12) , such as silicon dioxide, deposited thereon. The cermet layer (14) is deposited on the silicon dioxide layer (12). A photoresist layer (16) is deposited and patterned on the cermet layer (14) followed by the deposition of a layer of aluminum (18) . The cermet (14) is then preferentially etched with a mild, room temperature hydrofluoric acid solution, diluted with hydrochloric acid, to form the desired cermet resistance pattern.","Summary:
The research aims to improve the etching process for patterning thin film cermet on a semiconductor substrate using a mild, room temperature acid solution. The process involves depositing a glass passivating layer, cermet layer, photoresist layer, and aluminum layer. The cermet layer is then etched with a diluted hydrofluoric acid solution to form the desired pattern. While the process offers improved etching results, potential drawbacks include the use of hydrofluoric acid, which can be hazardous and require proper handling and safety measures. Energy efficiency is not a primary focus of the research."
US,9859218,2018-01-02,"Semiconductor structures including copper interconnect structures and methods include selective surface modification of copper by providing a CuxTiyNz alloy in the surface. The methods generally include forming a titanium nitride layer on an exposed copper surface followed by annealing to form the CuxTiyNz alloy in the exposed copper surface. Subsequently, the titanium layer is removed by a selective wet etching.","Summary:
The research aims to improve the performance of copper interconnects in semiconductor structures by selectively modifying the surface of copper with a CuxTiyNz alloy. This aims to reduce electromigration and improve the overall reliability of the interconnects. The methods involve forming a titanium nitride layer on the exposed copper surface, followed by annealing to form the CuxTiyNz alloy. The titanium layer is then removed by selective wet etching. While the research shows promise in improving interconnect reliability, potential drawbacks include the difficulty in controlling the thickness of the CuxTiyNz alloy and the potential for degradation due to high temperatures during annealing. Energy efficiency is not a primary focus of the research."
US,5514414,1996-05-07,"Apparatus and method for condensing a solderless flux vapor onto a work surface to be soldered, such as an electronic circuit board. The flux vapor is created by heating flux in a liquid state to a temperature greater than the temperature of the work surface. Flux is applied to the work surface without the use of any volatile organic chemicals.","Summary:
The invention aims to improve the soldering process by condensing a solderless flux vapor onto a work surface without using volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The vapor is created by heating the flux in a liquid state to a temperature above the work surface temperature. The invention eliminates the need for VOCs, which are harmful to the environment and human health. However, the method may be less effective in certain situations, such as when the work surface is not heated to the optimal temperature. Additionally, the energy efficiency of the method is not discussed in the text."
US,10115603,2018-10-30,"Methods for removing a passivation film from a copper surface can include exposing the passivation film to a vapor phase organic reactant, for example at a temperature of 100째 C. to 400째 C. In some embodiments, the passivation film may have been formed by exposure of the copper surface to benzotriazole, such as can occur during a chemical mechanical planarization process. The methods can be performed as part of a process for integrated circuit fabrication. A second material can be selectively deposited on the cleaned copper surface relative to another surface of the substrate.","Summary:
The research aims to improve the removal of passivation films from copper surfaces in integrated circuit fabrication. The methods involve exposing the passivation film to a vapor phase organic reactant at temperatures of 100째 C. to 400째 C. While the methods show promise, potential drawbacks include the risk of degradation of the copper surface and the need for precise control of temperature and reactant concentration. Energy efficiency is not a primary focus of the research."
