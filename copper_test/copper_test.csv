US,4927472,1990-05-22,"A conversion coating, predominantly consisting of tin phosphate, can be deposited on steel or tin plated steel surfaces by contact with a solution containing phosphate ions, tin ions, an oxidizing agent such as chlorate, and a chelating agent for the tin ions, the latter to prevent the rapid loss of tin from the solution that otherwise would occur. A coating that confers excellent resistance to corrosion in hot water is formed on drawn and ironed thinly tin plated cans."
US,5352331,1994-10-04,"An etching process for patterning thin film cermet (14) on a semiconductor substrate (10) using a mild, room temperature acid solution as the etchant. The semiconductor substrate (10) has a glass passivating layer (12) , such as silicon dioxide, deposited thereon. The cermet layer (14) is deposited on the silicon dioxide layer (12). A photoresist layer (16) is deposited and patterned on the cermet layer (14) followed by the deposition of a layer of aluminum (18) . The cermet (14) is then preferentially etched with a mild, room temperature hydrofluoric acid solution, diluted with hydrochloric acid, to form the desired cermet resistance pattern."
US,9859218,2018-01-02,"Semiconductor structures including copper interconnect structures and methods include selective surface modification of copper by providing a CuxTiyNz alloy in the surface. The methods generally include forming a titanium nitride layer on an exposed copper surface followed by annealing to form the CuxTiyNz alloy in the exposed copper surface. Subsequently, the titanium layer is removed by a selective wet etching."
US,5514414,1996-05-07,"Apparatus and method for condensing a solderless flux vapor onto a work surface to be soldered, such as an electronic circuit board. The flux vapor is created by heating flux in a liquid state to a temperature greater than the temperature of the work surface. Flux is applied to the work surface without the use of any volatile organic chemicals."
US,10115603,2018-10-30,"Methods for removing a passivation film from a copper surface can include exposing the passivation film to a vapor phase organic reactant, for example at a temperature of 100° C. to 400° C. In some embodiments, the passivation film may have been formed by exposure of the copper surface to benzotriazole, such as can occur during a chemical mechanical planarization process. The methods can be performed as part of a process for integrated circuit fabrication. A second material can be selectively deposited on the cleaned copper surface relative to another surface of the substrate."
