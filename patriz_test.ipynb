Field of the Invention\\nThis invention relates to a stroller, and more particularly\\nto a wheel assembly for a Stroller, which includes a Single\\nwheel.\\n2. Description of the Related Art\\nReferring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a conventional stroller 1 is\\n5:\\n2\\nof a preferred embodiment of this invention, with reference\\nto the accompanying drawings, in which:\\nFIG. 1 is a perspective view of a conventional stroller that\\nincludes two front wheel assemblies, each of which has two\\nfront wheels;\\nFIG. 2 is a bottom view of one front wheel assembly of\\n10\\nshown to include a stroller frame 10 with four legs 101, two\\nfront wheel assemblies 11 mounted respectively to two of\\nthe legs 101, and two rear wheel assemblies 12 mounted\\nrespectively to the other two of the legs 101. FIG. 2 is a\\n15\\n13, a wheel seat 14 disposed between the front wheels 12,\\nand a wheel axle 15 extending through the front wheels 13\\nand the wheel seat 14. Each of the wheel seats 14 has a\\nleg-connecting portion 141 sleeved rotatably on a respective\\none of the legS 101, and an axle-connecting portion 142,\\nwithin which the wheel axle 15 is journalled. To enhance the\\ncomfort of the baby carried on the stroller 1, a vibration\\nabsorbing device (not shown) can be disposed within the\\naxle-connecting portion 142 of each of the wheel Seats 14.\\nWhen it is desired to push the stroller 1 to advance along\\na straight path, a forward force (A) is applied to the Stroller\\nframe 10. In each of the front wheel assemblies 11, since the\\nforward force (A) is located midway between two frictional\\nforces (B) that are generated between the ground and the\\n-\\nfront wheels 13 and since the direction of the forward force\\n(A) is parallel to those of the frictional forces (B), the stroller\\n35\\n1 can advance along a straight path 16. When the stroller 1\\nmoves over a lawn or uneven road Surfaces, it is necessary\\nfor the Stroller wheels to have a large diameter So as to\\nensure the comfort of the baby. However, if each of the front\\nwheel assemblies 11 has two large-diameter front wheels 13,\\nthe total volume and weight of the stroller 1 will increase\\nsignificantly so that it is difficult to push the stroller 1.\\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\\nThe object of this invention is to provide a wheel assem\\nbly for a stroller, which includes a single wheel, thereby\\nreducing the total Volume and weight of the Stroller.\\nAccording to this invention, a wheel assembly for a\\nStroller having a stroller frame is adapted to be mounted to\\nthe Stroller frame, and comprises a wheel unit including a\\nwheel and a wheel axle that is coupled to the wheel So as to\\npermit rotation of the wheel about the wheel axle. The wheel\\nhas a rim and a wheel wall. The rim defines a mounting\\nSpace therein, and has a vertical inner Side Surface that is\\nadapted to be proximate to the Stroller frame, a vertical outer\\nSide Surface that is opposite to the inner Side Surface and that\\nis adapted to be distal from the Stroller frame, and a vertical\\ncentral plane that is located between the inner and outer side\\nSurfaces. A fixed Seat is adapted to be mounted fixedly to the\\nStroller frame, and has a pivot-mounting portion that extends\\ninto the mounting Space in the wheel of the wheel unit. A\\nVertical pivot shaft is disposed on the pivot-mounting por\\ntion of the fixed Seat, and extends in the central plane of the\\nrim of the wheel unit. A wheel seat unit is connected to the\\nwheel unit and the vertical pivot shaft, and is rotatable about\\nthe vertical pivot shaft. The wheel axle is journalled on the\\nwheel Seat.\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\\nThese and other features and advantages of this invention\\nwill become apparent in the following detailed description\\n65\\n20\\nbottom view of one of the front wheel assemblies 11. Each\\nof the front wheel assemblies 11 includes two front wheels\\nthe conventional Stroller;\\nFIG. 3 is a partly exploded perspective view of the\\npreferred embodiment of a wheel assembly according to this\\ninvention;\\nFIG. 4 is a perspective view of a stroller incorporating the\\npreferred embodiment;\\nFIG. 5 is a partly sectional view of the preferred embodi\\nment when a wheel is disposed at a forward position;\\nFIG. 6 is an exploded perspective view of the preferred\\nembodiment;\\nFIG. 7 is a partly sectional view of the preferred embodi\\nment when the wheel is disposed at an inclined position;\\nFIG. 8 is a side view of the preferred embodiment; and\\nFIG. 9 is a fragmentary side view of the preferred\\nembodiment illustrating how vibration of the wheel is\\nabsorbed.\\n25\\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE\\nPREFERRED EMBODIMENT\\n30\\nReferring to FIGS. 3 and 4, a stroller is shown to include\\ntwo front wheel assemblies 20, a stroller frame 21, a\\nhand-push frame 22, and two rear wheel assemblies 23.\\nEach of the front wheel assemblies 20 embodies a wheel\\nassembly according to this invention. The stroller frame 21\\nincludes two side bars 211, a front bar 212 having two ends\\nthat are connected respectively and fixedly to front ends of\\nthe side bars 211, and a rear bar 213 that is connected fixedly\\nto rear ends of the side bars 211. The front wheel assemblies\\n40\\n20 are mounted respectively to two ends of the front bar 212\\nof the stroller frame 21. The hand-push frame 22 is mounted\\npivotally to the side bars 211. The rear wheel assemblies 23\\nare mounted respectively to two ends of the rear bar 213.\\nOne of the front wheel assemblies 20 will be described in\\nthe Succeeding paragraphs.\\nThe front wheel assembly 20 includes a wheel unit 3, a\\n45\\nfixed seat 4, a vertical pivot shaft 5, a wheel seat unit 6, and\\na braking mechanism 7.\\nReferring to FIGS. 3 and 5, the wheel unit 3 includes a\\n50\\n55\\nwheel 31 and a wheel axle 32 that is coupled to the wheel\\n31 so as to permit rotation of the wheel 31 about the wheel\\naxle 32. The wheel 31 has a rim 311, a wheel wall 312, and\\na mounting space 313 that is defined within the rim 311. The\\nwheel wall 312 has a circular central portion 314 and three\\nequidistant radial portions 315 that are connected fixedly to\\nthe central portion 314 and the rim 313. The rim 311 has a\\nvertical inner side surface 316 that is proximate to the\\nstroller frame 21, a vertical outer side Surface 316\\' that is\\nopposite to the inner side surface 316 and that is distal from\\nthe stroller frame 21, and a vertical central plane 317\\nbetween the inner and outer side Surfaces 316, 316\".\\n60\\nReferring to FIGS. 5 and 6, the fixed seat 4 includes a\\nVertical base plate 41, a sleeve portion 42 extending inte\\ngrally from the base plate 41 and sleeved fixedly on the front\\nbar 212 of the stroller frame 21, and a pivot mounting\\nportion 43 that extends into the mounting space 313 in the\\nwheel31 of the wheel unit 3 and that is formed with two first\\nhorizontal plates 431 which are aligned along a vertical\\ndirection.\\n\\nUS 6,938,300 B2\\n3\\nThe vertical pivot shaft S extends through the pivot\\nmounting portion 43 of the fixed Seat 4, is located in the\\ncentral plane 317 of the rim 311, and is formed with a\\nvertical slot 51 therethrough.\\nThe wheel seat unit 6 includes a rotatable seat 61, a\\nmovable member 62, a resilient element 63, a wheel seat 64,\\na horizontal pin 65, a horizontal pivot shaft 66, an axle\\nsurrounding tube 67, and two bearings 68.\\nThe rotatable seat 61 includes a vertical base plate 611,\\ntwo Second horizontal plates 612 that extend integrally from\\none side Surface of the base plate 611 and that are aligned\\nalong the vertical direction, two first vertical plates 613 that\\nextend integrally and perpendicularly from an opposite side\\nSurface of the base plate 611 and that are aligned along a\\nhorizontal direction, and two aligned vertical slots 614. The\\nsecond horizontal plates 612 are sleeved rotatably on the\\nvertical pivot shaft 5, and are disposed between the first\\nhorizontal plates 431 of the fixed seat 4. As such, the\\nrotatable seat 61 is rotatable relative to the fixed seat 4.\\nThe movable member 62 and the resilient element 63 are\\nsleeved movably on the vertical pivot shaft S between the\\nsecond horizontal plates 612 of the rotatable seat 61. The\\nresilient element 63 is shaped as a coiled compression\\nSpring, and is disposed immediately under the movable\\nmember 62 so as to bias the movable member 62 upwardly\\ntoward the upper second horizontal plate 612 of the rotatable\\nseat 61.\\nThe wheel seat 64 includes two vertical annular plates 641\\nthat are sleeved movably around the wheel axle 32, two\\ncylindrical sleeves 642 that extend respectively, integrally,\\nand perpendicularly from outer peripheries of the annular\\nplates 641 and away from each other, and two Second\\nvertical plates 643 that are connected fixedly to the annular\\nplates 641, that are aligned along the horizontal direction,\\nand that extend respectively through the vertical slots 614 in\\nthe rotatable seat 61. Each of the second vertical plates 643\\nhas a pivot end 644.\\nThe horizontal pin 65 extends through a pin hole 621 in\\nthe movable member 62, the vertical slot 51 in the vertical\\npivot shaft 5, and the pivot ends 644 of the second vertical\\nplates 643 of the wheel seat 64 so that the resilient element\\n63 can dampen movement of the wheel unit 3 relative to the\\nstroller frame 21, thereby absorbing vibration of the wheel\\nunit 3.\\nThe horizontal pivot shaft 66 extends through the first\\n4\\nture and operation of the braking mechanism 7 are not\\npertinent to the claimed invention, a detailed description\\nthereof will be omitted herein for the sake of brevity.\\nReferring to FIG. 7, when the wheel 31 is disposed at an\\ninclined position, because the vertical pivot Shaft 5 extends\\nin the central plane 317 of the wheel31, the wheel seat unit\\n6 can rotate smoothly relative to the stroller frame 21.\\nReferring to FIGS. 5 and 8, in which the wheel 31 is\\n10\\nshown to be disposed at a forward position, when a forward\\nforce (X) is applied to the Stroller frame 21, because a\\nfrictional force (Y) between the wheel31 and the ground and\\nthe forward force (X) are in the central plane 317, the wheel\\n31 will move along a Straight path.\\n15\\nReferring to FIGS. 6 and 9, when the wheel unit 3 is\\nSubjected to vibration, the resilient element 63 can dampen\\nthe movement of the wheel unit 3.\\nBecause the front wheel assembly 20 includes only one\\nwheel 31, the diameter of the latter can be increased Sig\\nnificantly to enable the stroller to move Smoothly over lawns\\nand uneven road Surfaces, thereby increasing the range of\\napplication of the front wheel assembly 20.\\nWith this invention thus explained, it is apparent that\\nnumerous modifications and variations can be made without\\n25\\ndeparting the Scope and Spirit of this invention. It is therefore\\nintended that this invention be limited only as indicated by\\nthe appended claims.\\nI claim:\\n30\\n35\\n40\\n1.
