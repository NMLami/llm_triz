The method determines the UEs with a maximum scheduling metric based on channel quality information and generates a common control channel signal for the UEs. The RU specific data signals are generated for each RU, and the signals are multiplexed and transmitted to the RUs through the CPRI. The proposed method aims to reduce the number of signals transmitted by the base station, thereby improving the energy efficiency of the base station. However, the proposed method may require additional signal processing and transmission resources, which could potentially degrade the performance of the system. The energy efficiency of the proposed method is not discussed in the provided text.'"
